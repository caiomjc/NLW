Project developed in Rocket Seat's Next Level Week event

## Description

This project was developed in the Rocket Seat's Next Level Week event and originally had 3 parts: server (written in node), web (written in react) e mobile (written in react native).
Unfortunately I only could watch the classes concerning the 2 first parts, so I could only developed the server and web parts of the whole project.

Part 1 was written in node with typescript and uses sqlite for the data base (with knex migrations).

Part 2 was written in react with typescript. Besides the server api (part 1), it also uses a public API to get data for Brazil's cities and regions.
